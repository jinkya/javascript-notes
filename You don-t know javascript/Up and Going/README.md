the lightbulb moment
blurry to crystal clear
to truly master the material that will allow them to code their desired outcome
The code isn’t just your job anymore, it’s your craft.
Enjoy the lightbulb moments!

From the earliest days of the web, JavaScript has been a foundational technology that drives interactive experience around the content we consume.
the technology and capability of JavaScript has grown many orders of magnitude
at the heart of the world's most widely available software platform: the web
a target for a great deal of criticism, owing partly to its heritage but even more to its design philosophy
the name is merely an accident of politics and marketing
exceedingly approachable to a broad audience of developers, even those with just little to no programming experience
its eccentricities make solid mastery of the language a vastly less common occurrence than in many other languages
full-scale production JavaScript can, and often does, barely scratch the surface of what the language can do.
elude true understanding even for the most seasoned of JavaScript developers
Because JavaScript can be used without understanding, the understanding of the language is often never attained.
eschew the common advice to retreat when the road gets rough
embrace all that JavaScript is and can do
With that knowledge, no technique, no framework, no popular buzzword acronym of the week, will be beyond your understanding.
You don't really know JavaScript, yet, but if you dig into this series, you will.
When developers encounter confusion, they usually blame the language instead of their lack of understanding.
It's easy to learn partially, and much harder to learn completely
