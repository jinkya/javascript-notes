Timeline
ECMAScript 3 ( December 1999 )
ECMAScript 4 ( July 2008 abandoned )
ECMAScript 5 ( December 2009 ) _ most browser supports this standard implementation.
ECMAScript 6 (2015) _ most browser can't compile it directly, thus need compilers to boil it down to the ES5 with compilers like abbel etc.
Now JavaScript started to gain traction, specifications were started to roll out each year with newer version. But yearly update means no more big releases like ES6
ECMAScript 7 (2016)
ECMAScript 8 (2017)
